Object Beautifier Pictures
=================

Images/pictures from:
1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/ObjectBeauty

This is in a separate repository because images in git repositories take up a lot of space and
should not be used.
Thus this repository is intended to be disposable and
preserve the history of the original repository,
where you actually find the code to be versioned.
